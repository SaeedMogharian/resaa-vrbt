The Video Ring Back Tone (VRBT) service is a customizeable service for a called party. It allows them to provide a fun, enjoyable, or entertaining video clip for callers to watch while the call is being connected. This service is an enhancement to audio RBT. It is designed for subscribers who want those that call them to have access to more exciting, personalized videos instead of ordinary RBTs.
